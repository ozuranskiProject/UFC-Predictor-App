# Unit Testing Framework Options for React Native

## 1. Jest
- Basic/go-to for React Native projects so it seems
- Snapshot testing
- Builtin 'mocking'
- A lot of documentation and big community

most recommended

I looked into stuff like Mocha and Detox a bit but everything just seems to be inferior to Jest for the purposes of efficiency in this simple project. Like Mocha has some manual setup which just doesn't seem worth it. It seems like Jest is the go-to for something like this, especially in React.
